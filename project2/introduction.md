In this project, we aim to shed light on the causes, consequences, and potential solutions to this complex problem. By employing thorough research tools and methodologies, we aim to gather data and insights that will give us a holistic understanding of child labour, thus contributing to the development of effective interventions.

## Research Tools and Methodology:
>To accomplish our research objectives, we will utilize a combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods. These will include conducting surveys, interviews, and focus group discussions to collect primary data from communities affected by child labour. Additionally, we will analyze existing literature, reports, and case studies to gain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying factors driving child labour and the impact it has on society.

## Supporting Material: 
>To support our research findings and provide a solid foundation for our project, we will be referring to various reputable sources such as academic journals, United Nations reports, and research studies conducted by renowned organizations. These materials will help us substantiate our arguments, present accurate statistics, and ensure the credibility and authenticity of our project.
