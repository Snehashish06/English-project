# Introduction

Child labour refers to the wrongful employment of children in various industries and sectors,
depriving them of their right to a proper childhood, education, and a healthy future. 
This concerning issue has been prevalent worldwide, affecting millions of children who are forced into labor at a tender age. 
Although child labour can be traced back to ancient times, it still persists in the modern world, perpetuated by poverty,
lack of education, and avaricious employers. The consequences of child labour are far-reaching and devastating, 
compromising the physical and mental well-being of children while hindering their potential to lead fulfilling lives. 
This project aims to shed light on the global issue of child labour, unravel its causes and consequences, 
and emphasize the urgent need for collective actions to eradicate this violation of children's rights.
