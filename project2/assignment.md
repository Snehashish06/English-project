## I. Causes of Child Labor:

1. Poverty and economic inequality:
   a. Lack of alternative sources of income for families in poverty.
   b. Low wages and exploitation of adult laborers push families to engage their children in work.

2. Lack of access to education:
   a. Limited access to quality education and the associated costs make child labor a necessity for some families.
   b. Inadequate educational infrastructure and discrimination against marginalized communities contribute to low enrollment rates.


## II. Impacts of Child Labor:

1. Education deprivation:
   a. Limited or no access to education hampers children's intellectual, emotional, and social growth.
   b. Illiteracy perpetuates the cycle of poverty and denies future opportunities.

2. Health and safety risks:
   a. Hazardous working conditions expose child laborers to physical health hazards, accidents, and injuries.
   b. Lack of access to healthcare and proper nutrition exacerbate their vulnerabilities.

## III. Key Solutions to Combat Child Labor:

1. Strengthen legislation and enforcement:
   a. Enact and enforce laws that establish a minimum working age, working hours, and safe working conditions.
   b. Promote international cooperation to address child labor, such as ratifying and implementing International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions.

2. Improve access to quality education:
   a. Ensure free and compulsory education for all children, regardless of their socioeconomic background.
   b. Invest in infrastructure, teacher training, and curriculum development to enhance educational opportunities.
