# Definition and forms of child labor

Child labor refers to the exploitation of children for economic purposes,
depriving them of their childhood and affecting their physical and mental development. 
According to various survey reports, child labor can take different forms depending on specific regional, cultural, and socioeconomic contexts.

The forms of child labor identified through these surveys include physical labor, 
where children are engaged in hazardous work such as mining, agriculture, construction, and domestic work. 
They are often subjected to long working hours, physical abuse, and exposure to harmful substances. 

Another form is bonded labor, where children are 
forced to work to pay off a debt owed by their families.
This practice often leads to debt bondage, 
restricted freedom, and harmful working conditions.

Additionally, child labor surveys reveal the prevalence of exploitative labor in the informal sector, 
such as street vending, begging, and drug trafficking. 
These children are vulnerable to exploitation, violence, and trafficking.

In conclusion, child labor encompasses various forms of exploitation, 
including physical labor, bonded labor, and informal sector labor. 
These survey reports shed light on the distressing reality faced by millions of children worldwide, 
highlighting the urgent need for measures to combat and eradicate child labor.
