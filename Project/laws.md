# Laws and policies relating to child labor in India

Child labor remains a significant issue in India despite efforts by the government and various organizations to combat the problem. According to recent survey reports, there are several laws and policies in place to address child labor in the country.

The primary legislation regulating child labor in India is the Child Labor (Prohibition and Regulation) Act of 1986. This law prohibits the employment of children below 14 years in hazardous occupations and processes. It also regulates the working conditions and hours for children between the ages of 14 and 18 years.

Additionally, the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act of 2015 recognizes child labor as a form of exploitation and provides for the rehabilitation and social reintegration of rescued child laborers. This act focuses on the protection and welfare of children and provides for their right to education, health, and nutrition.

The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, commonly known as the Right to Education (RTE) Act, was enacted in 2009. It mandates free and compulsory education for all children aged 6 to 14 years and prohibits their employment in any occupation.

The government of India has also launched various schemes and programs to address child labor, including the National Child Labor Project (NCLP) and the Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS). The NCLP aims to rehabilitate and mainstream child laborers through special schools and vocational training centers. The ICPS focuses on the protection of children from various forms of exploitation, including child labor.

Despite these laws and initiatives, the survey reports highlight several challenges in eliminating child labor in India. One major issue is the lack of effective implementation and enforcement of existing laws. Many employers and families continue to employ children, particularly in industries such as agriculture, domestic work, and small-scale manufacturing.

Poverty and social inequality also contribute to the persistence of child labor. Families in marginalized and economically disadvantaged communities often rely on child labor as a means to supplement their income. Inadequate access to quality education and social protection systems further exacerbate the problem.

Moreover, the survey reports indicate that child labor is prevalent in informal and unregulated sectors, making it difficult to monitor and address. Many child workers are also subjected to physical and emotional abuse, denied their basic rights, and deprived of proper education and healthcare.

To effectively combat child labor in India, it is crucial to strengthen the implementation and enforcement of existing laws, enhance social protection measures, and address the root causes of poverty and inequality. Comprehensive efforts are needed to promote access to quality education, create decent employment opportunities for adults, and raise awareness about the harms and consequences of child labor.

Furthermore, collaboration among the government, civil society organizations, and the private sector is essential to mobilize resources, share best practices, and develop sustainable solutions to eradicate child labor.
