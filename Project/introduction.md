# Introduction: 

Child labor is a pressing issue that plagues numerous 
countries around the world. In recent years, there 
has been an increasing awareness about the detrimental 
impact of child labor on the physical, emotional, 
and cognitive development of children. 
To gain a comprehensive understanding of this issue, 
our project aims to analyze survey reports on child labor. 
By delving into these reports, we intend to shed light on the prevalence, 
causes, consequences, and potential solutions to combatting child labor globally. 

Through our research, we aspire to contribute to the ongoing efforts in 
eradicating child labor and creating a safer, more equitable future for all children.
