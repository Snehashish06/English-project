# According to several survey reports, here are some of the main causes of child labor in India:

1. Poverty: Poverty is the primary driver of child labor in India. Families living below the poverty line often struggle to meet their basic needs and resort to sending their children to work in order to contribute to household income.

2. Lack of education: The lack of access to quality education in many parts of India leads to a large number of children being engaged in labor instead of attending school. Illiterate parents often fail to recognize the importance of education, perpetuating the cycle of child labor.

3. Limited employment opportunities for adults: High unemployment rates and limited job opportunities for adults force children to take up jobs to supplement family income, as they are often paid less than adults and are easier to exploit.

4. Cultural factors: Some cultural factors contribute to the prevalence of child labor in India. Traditional beliefs that children should contribute to their family's income from an early age, or the perception that educating girls is less important than boys, can result in children being sent to work instead of attending school.

5. Migration and displacement: Overcrowding and scarcity of resources in urban areas often lead to an influx of migrant families. Children accompanying their parents are vulnerable to being put to work due to the lack of alternatives.

6. Ineffective enforcement of labor laws: Weak implementation of labor laws and inadequate monitoring mechanisms allow many employers to exploit child labor without facing legal consequences. This lack of enforcement perpetuates the cycle of child labor.

7. Insufficient social protection programs: The absence of adequate social protection programs for vulnerable families fails to provide them with essential support, forcing children into labor to survive.

8. High demand for cheap labor: The demand for cheap labor in certain industries, such as agriculture, textiles, and construction, incentivizes the use of child labor as businesses prioritize profits over ethical employment practices.

In conclusion, poverty, lack of education, limited employment opportunities, cultural factors, migration, weak enforcement of labor laws, insufficient social protection programs, and demand for cheap labor all contribute to the prevalence of child labor in India, as reported by various surveys.
